## Writing Guidelines

### Opening Paragraph

**DO:**
- "With over 10 years of product ownership experience combined with hands-on AI/ML solution development..."
- Reference specific aspect of role that excites you
- Hook with your strongest relevant qualification

**DON'T:**
- "I am writing to express my interest in the position..."
- "I came across your job posting and..."
- Summarize your entire career

### Evidence Sections

Every claim must have a specific example:
- Include numbers: percentages, dollar amounts, team sizes, time savings
- Name companies when they add credibility
- Use active voice and strong verbs
- Focus on outcomes, not just activities

**Good:** "At Ameriprise, I owned a B2C product serving 717,000 clients, developing the strategic direction that reduced vendor migration costs from $7M to $3.5M."

**Bad:** "I have experience with product ownership and vendor management in financial services."

### Technical Alignment Section

Only include if role has specific technical requirements:
- Mirror exact terminology from job description
- Group related technologies logically
- Show breadth and depth appropriately
- Don't list technologies you can't discuss confidently

### Closing Paragraph

**DO:**
- "I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to your AI/ML initiatives."
- Reference specific company initiative or challenge
- Express genuine enthusiasm without desperation

**DON'T:**
- "I hope to hear from you soon."
- "Please consider my application."
- Use overly eager or desperate language

## Visual Design Principles

### Header Design

**Classic:** Simple name + contact info, minimal styling
**Modern:** Subtle accent color in name, clean divider line
**Creative:** Centered layout, can include tagline, light background accent

### Section Headers

- Use ## for main sections (Relevant Experience, Technical Alignment)
- **Bold labels** for subsections within evidence
- Consistent formatting throughout

### White Space

- Don't crowd the page
- Clear separation between sections
- Adequate margins (minimum 0.75 inch)
- Line spacing 1.15-1.3

### Length

**Maximum:** Single page (350-450 words)

If you're going over one page:
- Cut the weakest evidence paragraph
- Tighten language (remove filler words)
- Combine related points
- Move detailed technical lists to resume

---

## Matching Cover Letter to Resume

### Visual Consistency

- Use same accent color as resume
- Match font family
- Similar header treatment
- Consistent contact info formatting

### Content Complementarity

Cover letter should:
- Expand on 2-3 key resume points with context
- Show personality that resume can't convey
- Address "why this role/company" specifically
- NOT simply repeat resume bullet points

### File Naming

Use consistent naming with resume:
- `{FirstName}_{LastName}_Cover_Letter_{Role_Keywords}.md`
- `{FirstName}_{LastName}_Resume_{Role_Keywords}.md`

## ATS Considerations

Cover letters are less frequently parsed by ATS, but still:

- [ ] Include job title in "Re:" line
- [ ] Use standard business letter format
- [ ] Include key skills from job description naturally
- [ ] Avoid images, fancy fonts, or complex formatting
- [ ] Save as PDF with selectable text
- [ ] Keep file size under 1MB

---

## Customization Checklist

Before sending, verify:

- [ ] Company name appears (spelled correctly)
- [ ] Job title matches posting exactly
- [ ] Recruiter/hiring manager name correct
- [ ] Evidence maps to their stated requirements
- [ ] No generic phrases that could apply to any job
- [ ] Tone matches company culture
- [ ] Contact info matches resume
- [ ] No spelling or grammar errors
- [ ] Under one page when rendered
