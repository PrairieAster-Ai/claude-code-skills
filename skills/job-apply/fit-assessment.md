# Job Fit Assessment Framework

A systematic approach to evaluating whether to apply for a position, based on research showing that candidates matching 60-80% of requirements have strong success rates.

## Key Statistics

- **62%** of candidates who applied for jobs they were "underqualified" for received offers
- **84%** of employers are open to hiring candidates whose skills can be developed through training
- **65%** of hiring managers will hire based on skills alone, without strict credential requirements
- Candidates matching **50-60%** of requirements are **twice as likely** to be shortlisted vs. those at 40-50%

## The Fit Scoring System

### Rating Scale

| Rating | Symbol | Points | Definition |
|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| Strong Match | ✅ | 1.0 | Direct experience or qualification; can provide specific examples |
| Partial Match | ⚠️ | 0.5 | Transferable skill, related experience, or in-progress learning |
| Gap | ❌ | 0.0 | No relevant experience or evidence |

### Requirement Classification

**Must-Have Indicators:**
- "Required"
- "Must have" / "Must possess"
- "Essential"
- "Minimum qualifications"
- First 3-5 requirements listed
- Anything tied to legal/regulatory compliance

**Nice-to-Have Indicators:**
- "Preferred"
- "Bonus"
- "Plus"
- "Ideal candidate would have"
- "Nice to have"
- Requirements listed after core qualifications
- "Experience with X is a plus"

### Must-Have Requirements

| # | Requirement | Your Evidence | Rating | Notes |
|---|-------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

**Must-Have Score:** ___/5 = ___%

### Nice-to-Have Requirements

| # | Requirement | Your Evidence | Rating | Notes |

| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |

**Nice-to-Have Score:** ___/4 = ___%

### Overall Score Calculation

```
Overall Score = (Must-Have Score × 0.70) + (Nice-to-Have Score × 0.30)
```

The 70/30 weighting reflects that must-haves are more critical to hiring decisions.

## Disqualifier Checklist

**Stop and do NOT apply if:**

- [ ] Missing legally required credential (medical license, law license, CPA, etc.)
- [ ] Missing security clearance that cannot be obtained
- [ ] Missing the ONE core technical skill the entire role is built around
- [ ] Experience gap is massive (they want 15 years, you have 2)
- [ ] Role requires relocation you cannot do
- [ ] Compensation is non-negotiably below your minimum

**These are NOT disqualifiers:**

- Missing 1-3 years of the "required" experience
- Unfamiliar with one tool in their tech stack
- Missing a "preferred" certification
- Industry experience in adjacent field
- Missing degree if you have equivalent experience

---

## Experience Gap Guidelines

| Gap Size | Typically Acceptable? | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 1-2 years short | ✅ Yes | Emphasize depth and impact over years |
| 3-4 years short | ⚠️ Maybe | Need strong achievements or referral |
| 5+ years short | ❌ Usually no | Consider more junior role |
| 10+ years short | ❌ No | This is not your role yet |

### Substitution Equivalencies

Many employers accept these substitutions:

| Missing | Potential Substitute |
|---------|---------------------|
| Bachelor's degree | 4+ years relevant experience |
| 2 years experience | Relevant degree + projects |
| Specific technology | Similar technology + demonstrated learning ability |
| Industry experience | Transferable skills + domain research |
| Certification | Equivalent experience + willingness to obtain |

**Look for:** "or equivalent combination of education and experience"

## Gap Mitigation Strategies

### For Technical Skill Gaps

**In Cover Letter:**
> "While my hands-on experience is primarily with [Related Technology], I've built [Similar System] using comparable architectural patterns. My track record of rapidly mastering new platforms—most recently learning [Technology] in [Timeframe] to deliver [Project]—positions me to quickly become productive with [Required Technology]."

**In Interview:**
- Acknowledge the gap honestly
- Demonstrate understanding of the technology
- Show evidence of rapid learning
- Offer a concrete plan to close the gap

### For Experience Year Gaps

**In Cover Letter:**
> "My [X] years of focused experience in [Domain] have been marked by accelerated impact, including [Major Achievement]. I've consistently delivered results typically expected of more senior professionals, as evidenced by [Promotion/Recognition/Outcome]."

**In Interview:**
- Focus on impact, not tenure
- Highlight scope and scale of your work
- Show trajectory of increasing responsibility

### For Industry Gaps

**In Cover Letter:**
> "While transitioning from [Previous Industry], I bring directly transferable expertise in [Skill] and [Skill]. My research into [Target Industry] has revealed significant parallels, particularly around [Specific Challenge], where my experience with [Solution] directly applies."

**In Interview:**
- Show you've done homework on the industry
- Map your experience to their challenges
- Demonstrate genuine interest in the domain

## The "Honest Assessment" Questions

Before applying, answer honestly:

### 1. Can I actually do this job well?

Not "Can I get this job?" but "If I got it, would I succeed?"

- Could I handle the day-to-day responsibilities?
- Do I have (or can I quickly develop) the core skills?
- Would I be set up to fail or to grow?

### 2. Is this a realistic stretch or a fantasy?

**Realistic stretch:**
- Missing 1-2 years experience
- Unfamiliar with one technology in their stack
- New to the specific industry but have transferable skills

**Fantasy:**
- Completely different career path
- Missing 5+ years experience
- No overlap with required skills

### 3. What's my compelling narrative?

If you can't articulate in 2-3 sentences why you'd succeed despite gaps, the hiring manager won't be able to either.

**Template:**
> "Despite not having [Gap], I bring [Strength] that enables [Outcome]. I've demonstrated this through [Evidence]."

### 4. Do I have a way in?

- Internal referral?
- Prior relationship with hiring manager?
- Compelling portfolio piece?
- Unique perspective they need?

Referrals can overcome 1-2 missing qualifications.

## When to Apply Anyway (Despite Low Score)

Apply even with a 50-60% match if:

1. **You have a strong referral** from someone at the company
2. **The role is newly created** and requirements may be flexible
3. **You bring a unique perspective** they didn't know they needed
4. **The company is growing rapidly** and may be flexible on qualifications
5. **You have a killer portfolio piece** that demonstrates exactly what they need
6. **The job has been posted for 60+ days** (they may be struggling to fill it)

---

## When to Walk Away (Despite High Score)

Don't apply even with a high match if:

1. **Red flags in the job description** (unrealistic expectations, toxic language)
2. **Company has poor reviews** on Glassdoor/Blind
3. **Compensation is significantly below market** without justification
4. **Role scope suggests they want 2-3 jobs in one**
5. **You're not genuinely interested** in the work or company
6. **Taking it would compromise** your long-term career goals
