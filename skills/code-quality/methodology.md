# Code Quality Methodology

Lessons learned and best practices from production code quality sprints.

## Core Philosophy

> **"Good enough to ship, clean enough to maintain."**

Code quality work exists to enable feature development, not replace it. The goal is a codebase that:
1. **Doesn't block developers** - No errors that prevent builds
2. **Doesn't hide bugs** - Type safety catches issues early
3. **Doesn't resist change** - Modular architecture enables refactoring
4. **Doesn't surprise** - Consistent patterns throughout

## Sprint Structure

### The 5-Sprint Model

Organize code quality work into themed sprints:

| Sprint | Theme | Focus | Typical Duration |
|--------|-------|-------|------------------|
| **1** | Critical Blockers | Errors that break builds/CI | 1-2 weeks |
| **2** | Quick Wins | High-impact, low-effort improvements | 1 week |
| **3** | Architecture | File structure, modularization | 2-3 weeks |
| **4** | Testing | Coverage, test infrastructure | 2 weeks |
| **5** | Polish | Documentation, edge cases | 1 week |

### Sprint 1: Critical Blockers (Do First)

**Goal**: Get to green CI/CD

**Focus**:
- ESLint errors → 0
- TypeScript errors → 0
- Broken tests → fixed
- Build failures → resolved

**Why First**: Nothing else matters if the build is broken. Developers can't work productively with red CI. This sprint has the highest ROI because it unblocks everything else.

**Anti-pattern**: Trying to achieve zero warnings before zero errors. Warnings can wait; errors cannot.

### Sprint 2: Quick Wins (Build Momentum)

**Goal**: Visible progress with minimal effort

**Focus**:
- Obvious duplication in same file
- Simple `any` → proper type fixes
- Unused code removal
- Import organization

**Why Second**: After critical fixes, quick wins build team confidence and demonstrate progress. These changes should be low-risk and obvious.

**Anti-pattern**: Scope creep. Quick wins should be individually completable in <2 hours. If it's bigger, move it to Sprint 3.

### Sprint 3: Architecture (The Hard Work)

**Goal**: Sustainable structure for future development

**Focus**:
- Large file modularization (>500 lines)
- Service layer extraction
- Dependency injection patterns
- API client abstractions

**Why Third**: Architecture work is risky and time-consuming. Do it after the codebase is stable (Sprint 1) and you've built confidence (Sprint 2).

**Key Insight**: Modularization is not just about file size. It's about:
1. **Single responsibility** - Each file does one thing
2. **Testability** - Modules can be tested in isolation
3. **Replaceability** - Implementations can be swapped

### Sprint 4: Testing (Investment in Safety)

**Goal**: Confidence in changes

**Focus**:
- Unit test coverage for services
- Integration tests for critical paths
- Test fixtures and factories
- Mock implementations

**Why Fourth**: Testing requires stable architecture. Writing tests against code that will be refactored is wasted effort. Wait until Sprint 3 settles.

**Coverage Targets**:
- Services: 80%+
- Utilities: 90%+
- Components: 60%+ (harder to test, lower priority)
- Integration: Critical paths only

### Sprint 5: Polish (Professional Finish)

**Goal**: Maintainable for future developers

**Focus**:
- JSDoc for complex functions
- README updates
- Architecture documentation
- Edge case handling

**Why Last**: Polish is low-priority relative to functionality. Do it after everything else is stable.

## Prioritization Framework

### Impact/Effort Matrix

```
                    HIGH IMPACT
                         │
         P1: DO SOON     │    P0: DO NOW
    (Architecture work)  │  (Build blockers)
                         │
  LOW EFFORT ────────────┼──────────── HIGH EFFORT
                         │
         P3: MAYBE       │    P2: PLAN CAREFULLY
    (Minor improvements) │  (Major refactoring)
                         │
                    LOW IMPACT
```

### Priority Definitions

**P0 - Do Now (This Sprint)**
- Build failures
- Test failures blocking CI
- Type errors
- Security vulnerabilities

**P1 - Do Soon (Next Sprint)**
- Files >500 lines being actively modified
- High `any` concentration in core logic
- Duplicate code causing bugs

**P2 - Plan Carefully (Roadmap)**
- Major architectural changes
- Framework upgrades
- Test infrastructure overhaul

**P3 - Maybe (Backlog)**
- Style inconsistencies
- Minor duplication
- Optional type improvements

## Refactoring Patterns

### Pattern 1: File Modularization

**When**: File exceeds 500 lines of meaningful code (not data)

**Process**:
```
Before:
  src/services/bigService.ts (800 lines)

After:
  src/services/bigService/
  ├── index.ts              (re-exports, <50 lines)
  ├── types.ts              (interfaces)
  ├── utils.ts              (pure functions)
  ├── featureA.ts           (cohesive group 1)
  ├── featureB.ts           (cohesive group 2)
  └── __tests__/
      ├── featureA.test.ts
      └── featureB.test.ts
```

**Key Decisions**:
1. **What stays in index.ts?** Only re-exports and minimal orchestration
2. **How to group?** By feature/responsibility, not by type (don't group all interfaces together)
3. **What about existing imports?** Index re-exports maintain backward compatibility

**Example**:
```
bigService.ts (700 lines) →
  bigService/
  ├── index.ts           (re-exports)
  ├── types.ts           (interfaces)
  ├── featureA.ts        (cohesive group 1)
  ├── featureB.ts        (cohesive group 2)
  ├── utils.ts           (shared helpers)
  └── __tests__/
      ├── featureA.test.ts
      └── featureB.test.ts
```

### Pattern 2: Type Safety Improvement

**When**: File has 5+ `any` types

**Process**:
1. **Audit**: List all `any` usages with context
2. **Categorize**:
   - External data (API responses) → Create interface + type guard
   - Internal state → Fix type inference
   - Truly unknown → Use `unknown` with narrowing
3. **Prioritize**: Core business logic first, utilities last
4. **Test**: Type guards need unit tests

**Template for External Data**:
```typescript
// Before
const data: any = await api.fetch();

// After
interface ApiResponse {
  items: Item[];
  total: number;
}

function isApiResponse(data: unknown): data is ApiResponse {
  return (
    typeof data === 'object' &&
    data !== null &&
    'items' in data &&
    Array.isArray((data as ApiResponse).items)
  );
}

const data = await api.fetch();
if (!isApiResponse(data)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid API response');
}
// data is now typed as ApiResponse
```

### Pattern 3: Duplication Elimination

**When**: Same code appears 3+ times

**Process**:
1. **Verify semantic duplication** - Same purpose, not just similar syntax
2. **Choose extraction location**:
   - Same file → Helper function
   - Same directory → Shared module
   - Cross-cutting → Utils or hooks
3. **Extract with tests** - Write test for shared code first
4. **Update call sites** - One at a time, verify each

**Anti-patterns**:
- Extracting code used only 2 times (premature abstraction)
- Creating "utils" that are actually domain logic
- Parameterizing everything (simple duplication is sometimes clearer)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Incremental progress** - Small commits, frequent validation
2. **Metric tracking** - Visible progress motivates continuation
3. **Clear targets** - "Zero warnings" is unambiguous
4. **Parallel work** - Lint fixes don't block type fixes

### What Didn't Work

1. **Big bang refactoring** - Too risky, hard to validate
2. **Stale PRD data** - Always re-measure before starting work
3. **Ignoring test coverage** - Refactoring without tests is dangerous
4. **Perfectionism** - "Good enough" beats "never shipped"

### Key Insights

1. **Measure first, always** - Assumptions about hotspots are often wrong
2. **Modularization > line count** - A well-organized 600-line file beats a poorly-organized 400-line file
3. **Tests enable refactoring** - Coverage should precede major changes
4. **Data files are different** - A 2000-line config is fine; a 2000-line service is not
5. **Warnings are debt** - They accumulate and desensitize the team

## When to Stop

Code quality work is **done enough** when:

- [ ] Build passes (0 errors)
- [ ] CI is green (tests pass)
- [ ] Type safety protects critical paths
- [ ] New developers can understand structure
- [ ] Changes can be made without fear

Code quality work is **never done** - but that's okay. Maintain through:
- Pre-commit hooks (lint, type-check)
- CI enforcement (no warnings policy)
- Code review standards
- Periodic audits (quarterly)

## Tools Reference

| Tool | Purpose | Command |
|------|---------|---------|
| ESLint | Lint analysis | `npm run lint` |

| Vitest | Test coverage | `npx vitest --coverage` |
| jscpd | Duplication | `npx jscpd src --reporters json` |
